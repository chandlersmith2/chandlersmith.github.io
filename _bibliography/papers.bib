    abstract = {The Euclidean distance geometry (EDG) problem is a crucial machine learning task that appears
                in many applications. Utilizing the pairwise Euclidean distance information of a given point set,
                EDG reconstructs the configuration of the point system. When only partial distance information
                is available, matrix completion techniques can be incorporated to fill in the missing pairwise dis-
                tances. In this paper, we propose a novel dual basis Riemannian gradient descent algorithm, coined
                RieEDG, for the EDG completion problem. The numerical experiments verify the effectiveness
                of the proposed algorithm. In particular, we show that RieEDG can precisely reconstruct various
                datasets consisting of 2- and 3-dimensional points by accessing a small fraction of pairwise distance
                information.},
